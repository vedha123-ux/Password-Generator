A password generator is a tool that creates strong, random passwords to enhance online security. 
It helps users avoid weak or easily guessed passwords by combining letters, numbers, and symbols in unpredictable sequences. 
This is crucial for protecting accounts from hacking or unauthorized access, as complex passwords are harder to crack. 
Many password generators allow customization, like setting the length or including specific characters, making it easier to create secure passwords tailored to individual needs.
